<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 🎯 Rent Home Now API<a name="about-project"></a>

Rent Home Now API is the final capstone project for the Full Stack Developer Program at Microverse.

Rent Home Now API is RESTful API that facilitates the connection between property owners interested in renting out their properties and potential renters. The API allows for the creation of reservations on selected properties. It has been developed using the Ruby on Rails framework and uses a PostgreSQL database.

The app was built with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React/Redux frontend, located on separate repositories.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

you have to those tools in your local machine.

- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Rails
- [ ] PostgresSQL
- [ ] GIT & GITHUB
- [ ] Any Code Editor (VS Code, Brackets, etc)

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository using the following bash command in an appropriate location.

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:shahadat3669/rent-home-now-api.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```bash
  cd rent-home-now-api
```

### Adding credentials

Rails stores secrets in `config/credentials.yml.enc`, which is encrypted and hence cannot be edited directly. Rails uses `config/master.key`. If you have the master key, to add or change credentials in your terminal, run this command (change the name of you editor if you need for example code for VS Code)

```bash
  EDITOR="code" rails credentials:edit
```

This command will create the credentials file if it does not exist. Additionally, this command will create config/master.key if no master key is defined.
Here pass the --wait flag to make sure the encryption happens after the edits have been saved and the editor closed.

```bash
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

The scaffolded credentials.yml.enc looks like below:

```bash
  postgres_password: Database User Password
  smtp_user_name: SMTP User name
  smtp_password: SMTP User password
```

To learn more [check Custom Credentials](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials) documentation.

### Add necessary packages

For installing necessary packages, run the following bash command:

```bash
  bundle install
```

### Setup Database locally

For setup database locally, run the following bash commands:

- Create a database in your local machine

```bash
  rails db:create
```

- Run necessary migrations

```bash
  rails db:migrate
```

- To insert seeds in the database, you can run:

```bash
  rails db:seed
```

### Run the server in development mode

In the project directory, you can run the project by using following bash command:

```bash
  ./bin/dev
```

And now you can visit the site with the URL http://localhost:4000

### Run the test

Before running the test command, please make sure you have run `rails db:seed`.

For testing you can run following bash command:

```bash
  bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern "spec/requests/api/**/*"
```
